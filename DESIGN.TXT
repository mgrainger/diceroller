Roll.py Design Document

This document describes the features intended to be implemented in Roll.py for version 1.0 to be considered complete.

* Command Line Interface that can take the following commands.
** Roll [die equation|dice pool name] - Will roll dice formula of the form XdY+Z where 
   X= number of dice, 
   Y= number of sides for each of X dice, 
   Z= additional integer modifer (positive or negative).
   Additional modifiers:
   -a = roll die with advantage
   -d = roll die with disadvantage
   -v show individiual die rolls
   -l = display label value
   -hd = return half the total value, rounded down
   -hu = return half the total value, rounded up
   -(?) = discard dice of certain value, reroll it and add to value normally.
   -(?) = discard lowest value die.
** Print = 
** New [diecpool] = create a new dice pool
** View [dicepool] = display dice pool details
** Clear [dicepool]= clear indicated dice pool, "all" clears all dice pools
** Add [dice equation] [dicepool] = Add dice to dicepool
** Exit = Exit Rolll.py
* Ability for each die object to have different values for the label and numerical value for each side.
* 

die Class
The "die" class should know how to: 
* Roll itself and return a label and integer value for the face rolled.
* Create itself based on a numerical value of the sides. 
** Default to the labels being string versions of the numerical values.
?? Include impossible die types?
?? Max side value?
?? Min side value?
?? How to handle percentile die?
Create die function needs to take in following values
* Number of sides of the die. Integer
* Labels of sides of the die.  Array of string values.  
* Starting integer value. 
* Increment integer value

VARIABLES:
* die_name: The name of the indiviual Die. i.e. "Wild"
